    Make sure `Future.wait_id()` fails deterministically in a case of problem
    submit error. Previously it would hang if SAPI didn't return problem_id for
    whatever reason.
    See `#469 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/469>`_
    and `#511 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/511>`_.
