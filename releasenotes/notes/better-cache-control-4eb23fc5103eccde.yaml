features:
  - |
    Add a per-call cached value maximum age (``maxage_``) for functions
    decorated with ``@cached``.
  - |
    Allow specifying cache key explicitly, instead of using all arguments of a
    function decorated with ``@cached``.
  - |
    Add cache bypass control via ``disable()`` and ``enable()`` on the decorated
    function.
  - |
    Add ``@cached.disabled`` context manager (and a function decorator) that
    temporarily disables cache within the context (i.e. the decorated function).
    See `#503 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/503>`_.
