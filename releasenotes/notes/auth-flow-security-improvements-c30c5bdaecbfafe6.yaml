fixes:
  - |
    Use fixed authorization success URL, without any authorization query
    parameters appended (to minimize exposure), as they are not needed on the
    authorization server's success page.
  - |
    Improve CSRF protection on localhost redirect URI during authorization code
    exchange. Previously, ``state`` was verified only if supplied. Now it's
    mandatory. Please note this is an additional CSRF protection on top of the
    PKCE, just in case PKCE is not supported (or properly implemented) server-side.
