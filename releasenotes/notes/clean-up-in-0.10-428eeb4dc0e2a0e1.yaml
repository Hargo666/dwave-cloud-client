upgrade:
  - |
    Remove ``Client.solvers()`` method in favor of ``Client.get_solvers()``. It
    was previously deprecated in ``dwave-cloud-client==0.5.0``.
  - |
    Remove ``dwave.cloud.computation.Future.error`` property in favor of
    ``dwave.cloud.computation.future.exception()`` method. The property
    was previously deprecated in ``dwave-cloud-client==0.7.3``.
  - |
    Remove ``dwave.cloud.computation.Future.{eta_min,eta_max}``. These
    properties were previously deprecated in ``dwave-cloud-client==0.8.5`` when
    the underlying SAPI feature/field was removed.
