    Disk cache serialization changed from Python pickle to JSON. Currently, disk
    cache is used only for the list of Leap regions fetched from the Metadata
    API on ``dwave.cloud.Client`` instantiation.
    Upgrade should be seamless, as a new on-disk cache database file is created
    for each dwave-cloud-client version.
