    Add optional Leap authorization step to ``dwave setup`` CLI. During setup,
    we now install optional contributed packages, authorize Ocean to access Leap
    (``--auth`` and ``--oob`` flags), and finally create the configuration file,
    optionally pulling SAPI token from Leap API (if authorized) for the currently
    active Leap project, or project specified with ``--project`` option.
    See `#591 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/591>`_.
