features:
  - |
    Add ``strict_mode`` support to ``VersionedAPISession``. Strict mode is now
    the default, implying API requests will fail if type/version is expected and
    the response doesn't include it.
  - |
    Add ``version_strict_mode`` config option to ``DWaveAPIClient``. It
    corresponds to underlying session's (``VersionedAPISession``) ``strict_mode``.
upgrade:
  - |
    Response type version is now always required (regardless of ``strict_mode``)
    if type is expected and received, and version is expected.
