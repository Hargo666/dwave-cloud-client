    Add ``--project`` option to ``dwave config create``, to be used in conjunction
    with ``--auto``/``--auto-token``.

    When project is not specified, the configuration file is initialized with
    a SAPI token for the currently active Leap project.

    Project can be specified via project name, code or ID.
