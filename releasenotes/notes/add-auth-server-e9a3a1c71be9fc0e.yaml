features:
  - |
    Add a general-purpose, multi-threaded, WSGI application server,
    ``dwave.cloud.auth.server.BackgroundAppServer``. This server can handle
    redirect URIs in the OAuth2 authorization code flow.
    See `#563 <https://github.com/dwavesystems/dwave-cloud-client/issues/563>`_.
  - |
    Add ``dwave.cloud.auth.server.SingleRequestAppServer`` based on
    ``dwave.cloud.auth.server.BackgroundAppServer`` to specifically handle only
    one (valid) request to the OAuth redirect URI (and self-terminate after that).
