features:
  - |
    Add support for ``binary-ref`` answer encoding format, where answer data
    is not immediately present in the answer, but on an URI referenced in the
    answer response.
  - |
    Add ``dwave.cloud.computation.Future.answer_data`` property to hold the
    answer data of a resolved future. A call to ``.answer_data`` will block
    until computation future is resolved.
  - |
    Add ``dwave.cloud.api.models.UnstructuredProblemAnswerBinaryRef`` model, a
    subclass of ``ProblemAnswer`` for ``binary-ref`` answers, and a method
    for downloading answer data (resolving binary-ref),
    ``dwave.cloud.api.resources.Problems.get_answer_data``.
